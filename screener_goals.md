- `enriched_timestamp` injected into universe  
- Removed deprecated `yfinance_updated` field  
- Universe enrichment and scoring validated  
- AutoWatchlist builder + frontend rendering  

### Backend Architecture
- `run_pipeline.py` orchestrates refresh ‚Üí score ‚Üí build  
- `daily_refresh.py` wraps all scrapers with cleanup and audit  
- `cache_manager.py` handles cleanup (uses last valid market day logic)  
- Modular `signals/` folder with all enrichment logic  
- Universe Builder added (`universe_builder.py`)  
- `watchlist_builder.py` builds filtered, scored JSON output

- [~] Tier 1: Momentum Confluence (awaiting accurate premarket highs/lows from TradingView)  
- [~] Daily refresh runs manually, but automation flow is staged
