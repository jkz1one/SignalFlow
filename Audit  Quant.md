Signal Architecture
Experts: Use modular filters (Trade Ideas, Finviz, etc.) that the user can freely combine. Some use layered strategies or AI behind the scenes, but these aren’t usually tiered explicitly.

Your Screener: Uses explicit tiers (1, 2, 3) for signals, reflecting priority levels. Signals are pre-defined and streamlined for a specific strategy (morning momentum).

Key Insight: Your tier system mimics structured, multi-layered scans used in quant firms, but is more focused and automatic. Experts offer more flexibility, yours offers more specialization.

2. Scoring Logic
Experts: Generally don’t assign a composite score. Traders sort by a metric (volume, % change). Some advanced systems (Fintel, quant models) assign scores behind the scenes.

Your Screener: Assigns a clear numeric score based on tier hits (e.g. Tier 1 = +3, etc.), used to rank and prioritize tickers automatically.

Key Insight: This scoring is a major strength—Experts often require the user to mentally stack confluence, whereas yours does it automatically.

3. Modularity and Toggles
Experts: Extremely modular. Filters can be toggled, thresholds adjusted live, and multiple strategies saved.

Your Screener: Modular in code, but not yet configurable in UI. Some toggles exist (risk filters, tier views), but signal thresholds are fixed.

Key Insight: Adding user-configurable filters (like a frontend UI to change volume threshold) would greatly enhance modularity.

4. Data and Timing
Experts: Use real-time or near-real-time data, often tick-by-tick. Constantly updating intraday. Include fundamentals, news, and sentiment.

Your Screener: Snapshots at key times (e.g. 9:40am), using a mix of scraped data (TradingView, Yahoo). Covers premarket and early session well, but doesn’t update automatically intraday.

Key Insight: For your purpose (morning scout), this is effective. But it could miss later opportunities unless re-run. Adding multiple timed refreshes would make it more competitive.

5. Output and Visualization
Experts: Advanced UI features—mini charts, AI trade ideas, alert feeds, backtesting, visual tags.

Your Screener: Uses tags (e.g., Strong Setup, Risk Flags) and a clean layout to summarize why a stock scored high. Data transparency is strong.

Key Insight: This human-readable output is a strength. Adding simple visual elements (mini-charts, bar position in range) would help without overwhelming the UI.

Actionable Recommendations for Improvemen Expanded:
1. Real-Time Updates and Alerts: Consider extending the screener’s operation beyond the single 9:40am snapshot. For example, implement additional scheduled runs or even partial real-time updates. Even a midday refresh (say at 12pm) and an end-of-day scan for swing trade setups would capture more opportunities. In the future, hooking into a websocket or live API for continuous data could allow true real-time alerting when a new Tier signal triggers (similar to Trade Ideas’ streaming alerts), though this may require infrastructure upgrades. Starting with a lightweight scheduler (cron jobs or an in-app scheduler) to run run_pipeline.py multiple times a day (as hinted in the roadmap) would be a big step toward an intraday scanner rather than a once-daily tool.

2. User Customization of Criteria: To approach the flexibility of professional screeners, build a layer for user-defined filters or weightings. This could be an interface to adjust thresholds (e.g. what constitutes “High Volume” or the % move that defines Tier2 “Early % Move”). Even a simple settings file or UI form that updates a config JSON used by screenbuilder.py would let advanced users tweak the logic without digging into code. In the long run, implementing a small query builder UI (like Finviz’s filter checkboxes or a form with conditions) would open the tool up to broader use-cases. For instance, a user might want to toggle on a fundamental filter (like “Market Cap > $1B”) on a given day – currently that’s not straightforward. Making the criteria modular will future-proof the screener for different market conditions or strategies.

3. Enhanced Data Integration: Incorporate additional data signals to enrich the screening logic:

News and Sentiment: Integrating a news feed (e.g., using an API for headlines or even a sentiment score) can allow tagging or filtering stocks that have fresh news. For example, a tag like “News” or a criterion “Has earnings today” could be invaluable (many pro scanners let you filter by “news within last 24h”). Benzinga Pro’s integration of news is a big draw; the open-source tool could use free sources (RSS feeds, social media sentiment) to approximate this.

Unusual Activity: Consider scraping or pulling data on insider trades, options flow, or other “unusual” metrics if available. These could introduce new Tier signals (e.g., Tier2 or 3 signal for “unusual options volume” or “insider buying this week”). While this veers into advanced territory, it’s something institutional traders watch for and some pro tools incorporate via separate scanners.

Alternative Data: If targeting hedge-fund-level sophistication, one could integrate things like short-term earnings revision data, or crowd sentiment from platforms like StockTwits/Reddit (if accessible), to flag stocks with buzz. These could form another layer of scoring (perhaps a future Tier4 or a modifier to existing score).

Better Data Quality: Move toward official APIs for price/volume if possible (to reduce reliance on scraping TradingView). For example, using a service like Polygon.io or Alpha Vantage (with proper rate limits) could provide more reliable intraday data. This would make the tool more robust and closer to the data fidelity of pro systems.

4. Improved Visualization and UI: While the current text-based tags and flags are effective, adding some visual elements can greatly enhance quick analysis:

Mini Charts or Sparklines: Include a small chart for each stock on the watchlist (e.g., last 1-day intraday chart or a premarket chart). This visual cue helps confirm the numerical signals (did it actually break out of a range and hold up? A chart shows that immediately). Many screeners like Finviz include a tiny chart in the table view for this reason.

Color-Coding and Icons: Use colors or icons to highlight important things. For instance, Tier1 hits could be highlighted in a different color in the UI to draw the eye, or a flame icon for “hot” stocks with all three tiers triggered. Risk flags could use warning icons. Trade Ideas and other tools use subtle color-coding to indicate up/down moves, etc., which improves readability.
Interactive Details on Hover/Click: If a user clicks a ticker, show a detailed pop-up or side panel (similar to Trade Ideas’ single stock window) that might include the company profile, latest news (if integrated), and more detailed stats (full list of all signals values, not just which triggered). This keeps the main view clean but allows drill-down, reducing the need to switch to another site for basic info.

Custom Watchlist Inputs: Allow the user to input a custom list of tickers to scan in addition to the auto-built universe. Professionals often have their own watchlists – Benzinga and others let you filter scanner results by your watchlist. If the user’s screener had an option to include a “manual watchlist” (perhaps via a simple text input or file upload of tickers) and still apply all the tier logic to those, it ensures one doesn’t miss a favorite stock that isn’t in the pre-built universe that day.

5. Backtesting and Refinement: Introduce a mechanism to evaluate the screener’s effectiveness over time. This doesn’t need to be a full GUI backtester like OddsMaker, but even an offline script to replay historical days. For example, record the morning watchlist and see how those stocks performed by end of day or next day. Did the ones with Score >= 5 generally outperform? Such data could highlight if certain signals should be weighted more/less. The scoring model could then be adjusted (perhaps even automatically). This moves toward an AI-driven approach, where over many sessions the system learns which combination of signals yields the best trades – conceptually similar to Trade Ideas’ AI refining its strategies nightly. The open-source nature allows experimentation here; one could leverage machine learning to optimize the score weights or identify new patterns from the data collected.

6. Expand Universe Intelligently: The current design builds a universe from indices (e.g., S&P 500) and presumably notable movers. To reach a more “hedge-fund level” coverage, consider expanding the universe to include more mid-cap and small-cap stocks, especially those that have high premarket volume. You could incorporate a module to fetch top premarket gainers (from sources like Yahoo or Benzinga’s API) and automatically include them even if they’re not in the usual lists. This ensures the scanner catches, say, a small biotech stock up 50% on news – something a day trader would watch, but which an S&P 500-based universe would miss. Trade Ideas scans the entire market; while that’s heavy, you can approximate it by smartly including any stock that crosses certain threshold (gap or volume) in premarket. Just be mindful of the risk filters – many of those small stocks will trigger “low liquidity” or “wide spread”, which the risk logic can then flag or filter out as appropriate.

7. Learn from User Interaction (Long term): A cutting-edge improvement (taking inspiration from how some institutional systems adapt) is to monitor which stocks the user actually trades or watches closely from the list, and feed that back into the screening logic. For example, if a user consistently picks stocks with high short interest from the list, maybe weight that factor higher for that user. This becomes a personalized screener – something even pro tools don’t fully do yet. It’s an ambitious idea and likely a later-stage project, but it showcases how the open-source project could leverage flexibility to innovate beyond what static commercial products offer.
By implementing some of these recommendations, the user can elevate their open-source screener closer to a “professional-grade” tool. The goal should be to retain its strengths – the clear focus, interpretive scoring, and risk-aware filtering – while closing the gap in areas of data timeliness, flexibility, and user experience. The result would be a blended intraday scanner that encapsulates the best patterns observed in premium platforms (robust data, customizability, rich visualization) with the unique value of a tailored momentum scoring system. Such a tool would not only rival many paid solutions in functionality, but also offer the transparency and hackability that only an open-source project can provide.
